'Volcano' sees the boys going on a weekend camping trip with Uncle Jimbo and Ned, his pal from 'Nam. The outing comes under threat from a volcano and a creature named Schuzzlebutt. In 'Weight Gain 4000', Cartman wins an essay competition, and the prize is to be awarded by none other than American sweetheart, Kathie Lee Gifford. However, Mr Garrison was humiliated by Kathie as a boy, and plots with Mr Hat to kill her and gain his revenge. 'Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride' sees the South Park Cows' match-winning quarterback, Uncle Jimbo's nephew Stan, losing his form when he discovers that his dog, Sparky, is gay. In 'An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig', the boys decide to cross-breed Kyle's mail order elephant with Cartman's potbellied pig, Fluffy, in order to create a potbellied elephant. Things go awry when they enlist the help of twisted scientist Mephesto. 'Death' sees Stan in a quandry when his 102-year-old grandfather asks him to assist in a suicide attempt. In 'Pinkeye', Stan, Kyle and Cartman are preparing for the school Halloween party when the entire South Park community is transformed into brain-eating zombies. 'Tom's Rhinoplasty' sees Mr Garrison replaced by attractive substitute teacher Miss Ellen when he pays a visit to Tom's Rhinosplasty. It being Valentine's Day, the boys all fall for Miss Ellen, and Wendy soon senses that she has a rival for Stan's affections. In 'Starvin' Marvin', a batch of genetically engineered turkeys go on the rampage in South Park, while Cartman is mistaken for a starving African child by aid authorities and sent to Ethiopia. 'Mecha-Streisand' sees the boys discovering a prehistoric relic which spawns a terrible monster. Can a famous actor, critic and rock star come to their aid and save the world from the dawn of Zinthar? In 'Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo', South Park Elementary attempts to create a non-denominational holiday play, with distinctly un-entertaining results, while Kyle checks into the mental house. 'Damien' sees Jesus and Satan battling it out at South Park Forum after the son of the prince of darkness's arrival rather upstages Cartman at his own birthday party. 'Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut' sees Cartman questioning his true parentage. Could his real dad be Chief Running Water, who mom met many moons ago at the 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance? Or is it Chef? Or Mr Garrison? Meanwhile, Stan and Kyle attempt to win the America's Stupidiest Home Videos cash prize.","poster_path":"/sxCj0Iun46sUUsF5I2NQY6rml4c.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"1998-04-01","episode_count":18,"id":6706,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/oIDheshe9DYsviYn0qVy4yutrRp.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":"1999-04-07","episode_count":17,"id":6707,"name":"Season 3","overview":"In 'Rainforest Schmainforest', Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny visit the rainforests of Costa Rica on the 'Getting Gay with Kids' choir tour (listen out for a guest appearance by 'Friends' star Jennifer Aniston). 'Spontaneous Combustion' sees Stan's dad struggling to find a solution to the spontaneous combustion being experienced by people who hold their farts in out of politeness. In 'Succubus', the boys attempt to save Chef from a life of bliss with a life-draining succubus in female form. 'Tweek vs Craig' sees the boys splitting into rival camps in a playground debate over who is the hardest - Tweek or Craig? In 'Jakovasaurs', the town becomes over-run by incredibly stupid and annoying prehistoric creatures who breed at an exponential rate. A plan is hatched to get rid of the visitors, with Cartman's voice the only one raised in protest (he likes them, you see). In 'Sexual Harassment Panda', an encounter with an educational panda results in a spate of sexual harrasment lawsuits being filed in the town of South Park. 'Cat Orgy' sees Cartman left to the mercy of Stan's older sister Shelly when she babysits for him... and just what is wrong with Cartman's cat? In 'Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub', Mr Mackey's 'Meteor Shower Party' sees Stan and Kyle's fathers indulging their homo-erotic fantasies in the hot tub. 'Jewbilee' shows how Kyle and Kenny help thwart a plan to destroy the mighty prophet Moses at the Jewish scout camp. In 'Chinpoko Mon', Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny fall prey to the latest Japanese craze. 'Starvin' Marvin in Space' sees the boys reunited with their Ethiopian friend Marvin, who is looking for a new home. In 'Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery', South Park receives a Halloween visit from rock band Korn in an episode strangely reminiscent of 'Scooby-Doo!'. 'Hooked on Monkey-Fonics' sees the boys' attempts to win the Spelling Bee put in the shade when the contest is won by a pair of home-schoolers. All of which gives Cartman a really cool idea; 'Screw you guys - I'm going home-school.' In 'The Red Badge of Gayness', Cartman takes over a Civil War reconstruction in order to ensure that this time round the South wins. 'Mr Hankey's Christmas Classics' sees everyone's favourite piece of excrement hosting a festive musical special. In 'Are You There God?

The season was headed by the series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who served as executive producers along with Anne Garefino. The season continued to focus on the exploits of protagonists Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Butters in the fictional Colorado mountain town of South Park.\n\nThe season was the first of three new seasons Parker and Stone agreed to produce for the network under a renewal deal. It consisted of fourteen 22-minute episodes, which aired in two groups of seven episodes separated by a six-month gap. Prior to the season's premiere, all South Park episodes were made available for free viewing on the official series website, South Park Studios. The 13th season was the first to be broadcast in high definition and in widescreen. Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date.\n\nThe 13th season satirized such topics as the ACORN scandal, Japanese whaling, piracy in Somalia and the marketing tactics of the Walt Disney Company. Celebrities were spoofed throughout the season, including the Jonas Brothers, Kanye West, Carlos Mencia, Paul Watson and Glenn Beck, all of whom publicly responded to their portrayals. The episode \"Fishsticks\" attracted particular media attention due to rapper Kanye West's declaration that its jokes about his arrogance were funny but hurt his feelings. \"The F Word\", in which the central characters attempt to change the definition of the word \"fag\", was especially controversial and prompted complaints from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. A broadcast of \"Pinewood Derby\" in Mexico was pulled, allegedly due to its depiction of Mexican President Felipe Calderón. \"Fatbeard\" was praised by the crew of the USS Bainbridge, which was involved in the 2009 rescue of the MV Maersk Alabama from Somali pirates.","poster_path":"/15Lszg1L3w6vGGqFFoTN0asxj5C.jpg","season_number":13},{"air_date":"2010-03-17","episode_count":14,"id":6717,"name":"Season 14","overview":"This series finds Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters and co getting into fixes through their usual blend of innocence and mischievousness.

1","overview":"In 'Cartman Gets an Anal Probe', South Park is visited by aliens, who proceed to kidnap Kyle's little brother, Ike, mutilate some cows and probe Eric Cartman anally. 'Volcano' sees the boys going on a weekend camping trip with Uncle Jimbo and Ned, his pal from 'Nam. The outing comes under threat from a volcano and a creature named Schuzzlebutt. In 'Weight Gain 4000', Cartman wins an essay competition, and the prize is to be awarded by none other than American sweetheart, Kathie Lee Gifford. However, Mr Garrison was humiliated by Kathie as a boy, and plots with Mr Hat to kill her and gain his revenge. 'Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride' sees the South Park Cows' match-winning quarterback, Uncle Jimbo's nephew Stan, losing his form when he discovers that his dog, Sparky, is gay. In 'An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig', the boys decide to cross-breed Kyle's mail order elephant with Cartman's potbellied pig, Fluffy, in order to create a potbellied elephant. Things go awry when they enlist the help of twisted scientist Mephesto. 'Death' sees Stan in a quandry when his 102-year-old grandfather asks him to assist in a suicide attempt. In 'Pinkeye', Stan, Kyle and Cartman are preparing for the school Halloween party when the entire South Park community is transformed into brain-eating zombies. 'Tom's Rhinoplasty' sees Mr Garrison replaced by attractive substitute teacher Miss Ellen when he pays a visit to Tom's Rhinosplasty. It being Valentine's Day, the boys all fall for Miss Ellen, and Wendy soon senses that she has a rival for Stan's affections. In 'Starvin' Marvin', a batch of genetically engineered turkeys go on the rampage in South Park, while Cartman is mistaken for a starving African child by aid authorities and sent to Ethiopia. 'Mecha-Streisand' sees the boys discovering a prehistoric relic which spawns a terrible monster. Can a famous actor, critic and rock star come to their aid and save the world from the dawn of Zinthar? In 'Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo', South Park Elementary attempts to create a non-denominational holiday play, with distinctly un-entertaining results, while Kyle checks into the mental house. 'Damien' sees Jesus and Satan battling it out at South Park Forum after the son of the prince of darkness's arrival rather upstages Cartman at his own birthday party. 'Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut' sees Cartman questioning his true parentage. Could his real dad be Chief Running Water, who mom met many moons ago at the 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance?

The season was headed by the series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who served as executive producers along with Anne Garefino. The season continued to focus on the exploits of protagonists Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Butters in the fictional Colorado mountain town of South Park.\n\nThe season was the first of three new seasons Parker and Stone agreed to produce for the network under a renewal deal. It consisted of fourteen 22-minute episodes, which aired in two groups of seven episodes separated by a six-month gap. Prior to the season's premiere, all South Park episodes were made available for free viewing on the official series website, South Park Studios. The 13th season was the first to be broadcast in high definition and in widescreen. Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date.\n\nThe 13th season satirized such topics as the ACORN scandal, Japanese whaling, piracy in Somalia and the marketing tactics of the Walt Disney Company. Celebrities were spoofed throughout the season, including the Jonas Brothers, Kanye West, Carlos Mencia, Paul Watson and Glenn Beck, all of whom publicly responded to their portrayals. The episode \"Fishsticks\" attracted particular media attention due to rapper Kanye West's declaration that its jokes about his arrogance were funny but hurt his feelings. \"The F Word\", in which the central characters attempt to change the definition of the word \"fag\", was especially controversial and prompted complaints from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. A broadcast of \"Pinewood Derby\" in Mexico was pulled, allegedly due to its depiction of Mexican President Felipe Calderón. \"Fatbeard\" was praised by the crew of the USS Bainbridge, which was involved in the 2009 rescue of the MV Maersk Alabama from Somali pirates.","poster_path":"/15Lszg1L3w6vGGqFFoTN0asxj5C.jpg","season_number":13},{"air_date":"2010-03-17","episode_count":14,"id":6717,"name":"Season 14","overview":"This series finds Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters and co getting into fixes through their usual blend of innocence and mischievousness.
